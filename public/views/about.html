            Water is the most important and crucial element of earth that act as a primary resource for sustenance of life, food, industrial production and conservation of eco-biodervisity. According to  USGS 2016,  a total  of 1.386 million km3 of water is reserved in this planet as a form oceans, glaciers, and ice caps which is very difficult to recover for  use in daily life. Only 0.01% of total water resource is believed to be stored in the form of groundwater and surface water in its purest form to fulfil the demand of growing population. Therefore, the dependency on these water sources has increased but the rapid urbanization and industrialization in the present century has deteriorated the water quality. Unware of the quality of the water, the habitat in the vicinity of these sources uses the water for their drinking, domestic and irrigational purpose. The polluted water has a risk to their life as well as to environment. Therefore, assessment of water quality to determine its impact on human and environment has become essential. 
This e-platform informs about the suitability of the water around different areas of an industrial city Durgapur, West Bengal, India. With the extensive research, it also focuses on prediction of human health risk. It creates an awareness among the local people who are dependent on groundwater and surface water for different uses.
